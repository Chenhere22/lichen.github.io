Dear All,

I am seeking a Data Analyst/ Business Analyst/ Data Scientist position and am excited to apply my data science and digital analytics expertise to a dynamic international organization in Germany. My background includes working with SPSS, Stata, and Python as a Research Assistant at the University of Mannheim, where I developed strong data analysis and communication skills.

To support my transition from academia to a Digital Analyst role, I am currently enrolled in a Data Analyst bootcamp at DataScientest, enhancing my skills in Python, SQL, Pandas, Numpy, and machine learning. Iâ€™ve earned seven certificates in these areas and have practical experience with data visualization tools like Matplotlib and Tableau, with plans to learn PowerBI. Recently, my team and I developed predictive models for Kickstarter data, reinforcing my expertise in digital analytics.

In a recent project, my team and I analyzed Kickstarter crowdfunding data to develop predictive models aimed at forecasting campaign outcomes. This project was an excellent opportunity to apply my skills in digital analytics and predictive modeling. We preprocessed the data and plotted 15 graphs to understand the data structure. Besides, we train and test machine learning models that could predict the success of crowdfunding campaigns. This hands-on experience reinforced my practical knowledge and provided me with valuable insights into the application of data science in real-world scenarios.

As a Training Associate at Weixi Technology Co., Ltd, I improved a learning management system for 12,000 users and enhanced educational programs for 1,000 undergraduates, leading to a 30% increase in user engagement. This role strengthened my ability to apply data insights to real-world challenges.

I am eager to contribute to an innovative company in Germany and would appreciate any recommendations or referrals. Thank you in advance for your support.

Yours sincerely,
Li Chen
